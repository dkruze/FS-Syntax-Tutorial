This tutorial is intended for a beginner in functional language, and provides NO basis for setting up the use of F#. If you aren't sure that your computer can
  create and/or run F# apps with .NET, please refer to the official F# documentation for details:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/
  Each lesson provides an assignment with a corresponding example, and the expectation is that you will follow along with the tutorial and fulfill the assignment
  requirements as they come up. The above documentation also provides great detail regarding some of the ambiguities of this tutorial, including syntax for running
  programs from command lines or packaging codes in apps. This tutorial is not intended to be comprehensive in ANY way nor was it officially sanctioned by Microsoft
  or the F# team that maintains the language. This is simply a colloquial, armchair guide to the syntax and some of the primary functions of the language designed to 
  introduce a student to functional language, using a familiar system. This tutorial was made using Visual Studio Code on a Windows 10 Home computer, and was tested
  in that environment, as well as compiled. This was made as a part of the CSCI 355 Programming Languages class for the IUPUI School of Science, computer science dept.
